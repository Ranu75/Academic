## Kaggle competition : my work on Kaggle competition where I must find the best forecast from a simulated data

To validate the Machine Learning course, you get to participate in a Kaggle competition with all the final year students from ENSAI. The goal is to develop the best regressor for forecasting. My professor has provided you with simulated data to train and test various regressors, as well as another dataset with only Kaggle data features. 

In this work, you experimented with various models: 
- after normalizing the features, I tried several classic regressors, including `LinearRegression`, `LassoRegression`, and `RidgeRegression`. I also used `LinearRegression` with selected features through penalization.
- after standardizing the features, I used `SVR`.
- finally, I employed regressors from ensemble learning, such as `Bagging Regressor`, `Stacking Regressor`, `Gradient Boosting Regressor`, and `AdaBoost Regressor`.
  
## Bayesian statistics project

The aim is to study the potential association between poverty and lung cancer in the UK. To do this, data was collected in 44 neighbourhoods in the London area. For each area $i={1,2,...,44}$ was collected : 

 - the observed number $Y_i$ of cases of lung cancer in men aged over 65 living in neighbourhood $i$. 
 - the expected number $E_i$ of cases of lung cancer in men aged over 65 living in neighbourhood $i$. This is a covariate, i.e. a quantity that is assumed to be known.
 - an indicator $depriv_i$ of socio-economic insecurity for neighbourhood $i$. The higher the value of $depriv_i$, the greater the level of socio-economic insecurity in neighbourhood $i$.

## NLP project

This project was focused on an article from a newspaper. I extracted information from article and analyze them.
